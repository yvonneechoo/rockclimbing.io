        <h1>History of Rock Climbing</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                The earliest known roots of rock climbing lay in China where paintings dating 
                back to 200 BC show people rock climbing. In Europe and elsewhere rock 
                climbing was a means to climb mountains, hunt and collect valuable items. In 
                the late 19th century, European rock climbing became an independent pursuit 
                outside of mountain climbing with aid climbing (using equipment that acts as 
                artificial handhold or footholds) as the predominant style. The second half of 
                the 20th century saw the development of free climbing (climbing without 
                artificial holds and tools) and all the many climbing disciplines described 
                hereafter.
                Climbers are often individualists or organised in small groups of friends. They 
                are typically young (39% are under 18) but keep climbing until 60 and after. As 
                per 2016 the <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/" target="_blank">IFSC</a> estimates that 25 million people are climbing regularly and 
                that about 3,000 people climb for the first time every day.

        <h1>Climbing VS Bouldering</h1>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Climbing</u></h2>
            <p>
                Sport climbing is what many people mean when they say climbing. Indoor 
                sport climbing means climbing routes with a rope either in lead (meaning you 
                clip the rope in protection points using fixed quick draws while you climb 
                higher) or top-rope (meaning you are protected from falling by a pre-installed 
                rope). Depending on the gym, you might find routes with pre-installed ropes 
                for top-roping and/or routes for lead climbing. Of course, you can always install 
                Back to top 
                a rope (or have someone else do it) and top-rope a lead climb. The height (or 
                length) of indoor sport climbs depends obviously on the gym but are typically 
                between 10 and 30 meters and vary from slab (positive angle, less than vertical) 
                to steeply overhanging routes (negative angle, steeper than vertical).
                Indoor sport climbing requires a partner you can rely on for belaying (protecting 
                you from falling to the ground) and more equipment than indoor bouldering. 
                Climbing shoes, a harness, a belay device and, if you want to lead, a rope is
                required but typically most of it can be rented in a gym. Check your local gym 
                for beginner courses or find a reliable and experienced partner to start sport 
                climbing.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><u>Bouldering</u></h2>
            <p>
                Bouldering is climbing without rope at heights that typically allow you to safely 
                jump down back to the ground. In bouldering gyms (or the bouldering area of 
                any gym) the area below the climbing walls is normally protected with 
                mattresses to ensure a soft landing. Indoor bouldering is very popular as it has 
                some obvious advantages. You don't need to rely on a partner and can go 
                alone whenever you have time (even though it is way more fun in a group, but 
                you will most likely find like minded people in the gym), you only need climbing 
                shoes (that you can probably rent) and no other equipment (maybe a chalk 
                bag) and as you typically do not climb very high it is more easily accessible for 
                people with a fear of heights.
                From a climbing perspective bouldering allows you to focus on the climbing 
                and its individual moves without having to worry about protection, rope 
                handling and such. This typically allows people to make faster progress and 
                climb harder than in other disciplines. Later, it is also an excellent complement 
                to sport climbing as it allows you to focus on your technical and physical 
                weaknesses and specifically train them.

        <h1>Different Difficulty Levels</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                It won't be long and you will be faced with a discussion about the difficulty of 
                a route - indoor or outdoor, bouldering or sport climbing. Even though most 
                climbers climb for the fun of it, it seems to be human nature to measure your 
                own progress and compare yourself to your peers using a more or less suitable 
                system. In the climbing world - with all its variety - the rating or grading of a 
                climb is done using so called difficulty grading systems. As you can imagine, 
                there are many different grading systems, some by discipline but most by area 
                (e.g. different systems in different countries). theCrag handles and converts all 
                of them and if you are interested you can read more about them in the 
                <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/en/home" target="_blank">Grades 
                and Grade Conversions article</a>. The basic principle of all difficulty grading 
                systems is, that the harder a climb, the higher the number. This means that in 
                French scale a 6a is harder than a 5b or in HUECO-scale a V8 is harder than a 
                V6 and so on.
                How difficult a climb actually is is determined by many factors such as 
                steepness of the route, size and quality of holds, the distance between holds, 
                the difficulty of the movements to reach the next hold, how sustained a route 
                is and so on. Obviously, grades have a subjective component and what feels 
                hard to one person might feel less so to another. theCrag allows you to record 
                your impression and grading of a route which will provide evidence to how 
                close the 'assigned grade' to the true difficulty of a route.

        <h1>Equipments</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                When you enter a climbing equipment shop for the first time you are probably 
                overwhelmed by the amount of different equipment (often called gear) and 
                variants thereof. In this page we will just briefly touch on some of the most 
                important equipment you might need when you start climbing. You will find 
                out for yourself later what else you might need, as it heavily depends on what 
                disciplines you prefer, what equipment your partners have and what your 
                personal preferences for climbing are. Some of the equipments you need are as shown below...
